# 📊 About the Project & My Role
This project was completed as part of my **Data Analytics Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**.  
The objective was to analyze investment trends, financial behaviors, and investor preferences using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)** and build an **interactive dashboard in Streamlit**.

## 🏆 My Responsibilities
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Used Pandas to preprocess and refine datasets  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Generated descriptive statistics and key patterns  
- **Building Interactive Dashboards** – Designed a Streamlit app for user-friendly exploration  
- **Custom Calculations** – Implemented metrics and KPIs using Python functions  
- **Investor Behavior Analysis** – Studied patterns based on gender, age, goals, and risk factors  

This internship enhanced my expertise in **data analytics, Python scripting, and interactive app development**. 🚀
