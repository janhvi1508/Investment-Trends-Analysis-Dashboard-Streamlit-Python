# Introduction
Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that enables rapid creation of interactive web applications for data analysis and visualization. It allows:  
- Quick deployment of data apps with minimal coding overhead  
- Seamless integration with Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)  
- Interactive dashboard and report creation  

Streamlit is widely used for real-time data exploration, interactive analytics, and sharing data-driven insights.

# Objectives
This project was completed as part of my **Personal Project to enchance my skill**.  
The objective was to analyze investment trends, financial behaviors, and investor preferences using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)** and build an **interactive dashboard in Streamlit**.

## My Responsibilities
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Used Pandas to preprocess and refine datasets  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Generated descriptive statistics and key patterns  
- **Building Interactive Dashboards** – Designed a Streamlit app for user-friendly exploration  
- **Custom Calculations** – Implemented metrics and KPIs using Python functions  
- **Investor Behavior Analysis** – Studied patterns based on gender, age, goals, and risk factors
